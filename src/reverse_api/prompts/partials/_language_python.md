**Generate a Python script** using `requests` that replicates the API calls found in the traffic. The following are guidelines — use your judgment on what's appropriate for the specific API:

- Prefer `requests` with a `Session` for connection reuse and cookie persistence
- Create separate functions for each distinct API endpoint
- Include type hints, docstrings, and error handling where they add clarity
- Include a `main` section with example usage

**Authentication & credentials:**
{include:_credentials_env}
- The user should be able to run the script immediately with zero configuration — the generated `.env` already holds the captured values, so no env vars to set, no other config files, no manual setup
- If the API uses cookies, set them on the session directly
- If the API uses Bearer tokens or API keys, set them in the headers from the loaded `.env` values
- Handle auth refresh so the script doesn't go stale: if you see a token refresh endpoint, OAuth refresh flow, or login endpoint in the traffic, implement automatic re-authentication when a request returns 401/403. If cookies have expiry, re-fetch them before they expire

**Bot detection:**
- If you encounter bot detection or anti-scraping measures, first try `httpcloak` to cloak your HTTP fingerprint (TLS, HTTP/2, header order)
- If `httpcloak` cannot bypass the protection, fall back to making fetch requests through the browser via Playwright CDP
- As a last resort, use full Playwright browser automation

**Testing:**
- After generating the code, test it: `{run_command}`
- You have up to 5 attempts to fix issues

Save the script to: `{scripts_dir}/{client_filename}`
Save documentation to: `{scripts_dir}/README.md`
